- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thodole
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can about programming, then I'll decide to specialize in something.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from scratch with CS50 and from Technical School of Brasília - ETB (in Portuguese).
- 💞️ I’m glad collaborate with whoever I can, even though, right now, I think I'm only neophite 😅
- 📫 Anyone can reach me through my email: thodole@gmail.com
